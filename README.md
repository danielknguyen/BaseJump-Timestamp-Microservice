# BaseJump-Timestamp-Microservice
<h1>Free code camp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice">Timestamp Microservice full stack project</a></h1>
<p>Build a full stack JavaScript app that will check to see whether the string passed in as a endpoint parameter contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).</p>
<p>User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).</p>
<p>User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</p>
<p>User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.</p>
